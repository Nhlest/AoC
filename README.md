## How to run

### Haskell

```shell
stack run -- <list of modules to run or leave empty to run them all sequentially>
stack test # To run tests
stack test --ta '-p "01"' # To run tests for first day only
```

### Elixir

```shell
mix test # To run tests
iex -S mix
iex> Pepega.sample_function([3,2,1])
```
